# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for LLMs

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs). By integrating cloud-deployed RAG with LLMs, our solution improves accuracy, contextual relevance, and informativeness of the model outputs in real-world applications.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Combines LLMs with dynamic external data retrieval.
- **Enhanced Responses**: Increases the precision and relevance of model outputs.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Utilizes Docker and Kubernetes for robust deployment.
